Description: An R package to facilitate Bayesian analyses using JAGS
    (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). Key features include the
    conversion of a data frame into a suitable format for input
    into JAGS; the option to manually or automatically increase the
    length of the MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) chains until
    convergence is achieved; the option to run MCMC chains on
    separate processes; the ability to extract derived parameters
    including posterior predictive checks
    from an existing model using BUGS code (in the JAGS dialect)
    without additional MCMC sampling; simple generation of data
    frames quantifying the effect (and effect size) of particular
    variables with the other variables held constant.
