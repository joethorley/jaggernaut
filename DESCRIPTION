Description: jaggernaut is an R package to facilitate Bayesian analyses using
    JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). Key features include the conversion of a
    data frame into a suitable format for input into JAGS; the option to
    automatically update a model (increase the length of the MCMC chains) until
    convergence is achieved; the option to run MCMC chains on separate
    processes; the ability to extract derived parameters from an existing model
    using BUGS code without additional MCMC sampling; the ability to use BUGS
    code to generate dummy data sets and perform power analyses.
