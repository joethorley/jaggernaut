Title: Bayesian analyses using JAGS
Author: Joe Thorley [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Joe Thorley <joe@poissonconsulting.ca>
License: GPL-2
Description: Facilitates Bayesian analyses using
    JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). Key features include the conversion of a
    data frame into a suitable format for input into JAGS; the option to
    manually or automatically increase the length of the 
    MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) chains until
    convergence is achieved; the option to run MCMC chains on separate
    processes; the ability to extract derived parameters from an existing model
    using BUGS code (in the JAGS dialect) without additional MCMC sampling;
    simple generation of data
    frames quantifying the effect (and effect size) of particular variables with
    the other variables held constant; power analyses with both the simulation
    and analytic models defined using BUGS code (in the JAGS dialect).
