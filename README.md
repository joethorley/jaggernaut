jaggernaut is an R package to facilitate Bayesian analyses using JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler).

Key features include 

* the conversion of a data frame into a suitable format for input into JAGS

* the option to automatically update a model (increase the length of the MCMC chains) until convergence is achieved

* the option to run MCMC chains on separate processes

* the ability to extract derived parameters from an existing model using BUGS code 
    without additional MCMC sampling

* the ability to use BUGS code to generate dummy data sets and perform power analyses
