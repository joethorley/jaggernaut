# jaggernaut

**DEPRECATED** 

Development has moved to [jmbr](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/jmbr).

## Introduction

jaggernaut is an R package to facilitate Bayesian analyses using JAGS 
(Just Another Gibbs Sampler).

Key features include 

* the conversion of a data frame into a suitable format for input into JAGS

* the option to automatically update a model (increase the length of the MCMC chains)
until convergence is achieved

* the option to run MCMC chains on parallel processes

* the ability to extract derived parameters from an existing model using BUGS code 
(in the JAGS dialect) without additional MCMC sampling

* simple generation of data frames quantifying the effect (and effect size) of 
particular variables with the other variables held constant

## Installation

To install from GitHub
```
# install.packages("devtools")
