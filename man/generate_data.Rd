\usage{
generate_data(data, range = NULL, length_out = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of variables from which the data.frame will be generated}

\item{range}{character vector of the variables in data to 
represent by a sequence of values or NULL (the default)}

\item{length_out}{integer scalar of the maximum number of values in a sequence}
}
\value{
The generated data.frame which can then be passed to a model for the
purpose of estimating the effects of particular variables.
}
\description{
Generates a data.frame that can then be passed to a model to predict the 
effects of particular variables with the other variables held constant.
}
\details{
Unless a variable is named in range it is fixed at its base value. 
A continuous variable's base value is its mean value
of the same class, i.e., an integer variable's base value is its rounded mean.
A logical variable's base value is FALSE while a factor's is
its first level. 

Alternatively if a variable is named in range then a sorted sequence of 
unique values of the same class 
from the minimum to the maximum of the observed values with a 
length of up to length_out (by default 30) is generated. If length_out is less
than the number of possible values then in the case of a continous variable the
values are as evenly distributed as possible while in the case of a factor only
the first length_out levels are selected.

\examples{
data <- data.frame(numeric = 1:10 + 0.1, integer = 1:10, 
   factor = factor(1:10), date = as.Date("2000-01-01") + 1:10,
   posixt = ISOdate(2000,1,1) + 1:10)
   
generate_data (data)
generate_data (data, range = "numeric")
generate_data (data, range = c("date", "factor"))
generate_data (data, range = c("numeric"))
